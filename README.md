# n-Queens: A* vs CSP

This project solves the **n-Queens problem** using two Artificial Intelligence approaches:

- A* state-space search with different heuristics
- Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) formulation solved with OR-Tools CP-SAT

The goal is to compare the scalability and performance of search-based and constraint-based methods.
